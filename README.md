# Course Critic


A personalized, peer-driven course review platform built for Computer Science students at the University of Pittsburgh.

CourseCritic helps students make informed decisions when registering for classes by providing real-time feedback on courses and professors from fellow students. Developed as a final project for CS 1530, the platform bridges gaps left by legacy systems like RateMyProfessor and outdated departmental wikis.
